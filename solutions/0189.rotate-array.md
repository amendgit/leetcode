Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


Example 2:


Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


Note:


	Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
	Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int len = nums.size();
        vector<int> tmp(len, 0);
        for (int i=0, j=k%len; i<len; i++, j=(i+k)%len) tmp[j] = nums[i];
        nums.swap(tmp);
    }
