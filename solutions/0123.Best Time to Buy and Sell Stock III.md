Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

ltor[i]表示prices[0, i)的最大profit，rtol[i]表示prices[i, n)的最大profit。然后计算两者之和即可。时间O(n)，空间O(n)。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int len = prices.size(), profit = 0;
        if (len == 0) return profit;
        vector<int> ltor(len+1, 0), rtol(len+1, 0);
        profit = 0;
        for (int i=1, buy=prices[0]; i<len; i++) {
            if (buy < prices[i]) profit = max(prices[i] - buy, profit);
            else                 buy = prices[i];
            ltor[i+1] = profit;
        }
        profit = 0;
        for (int i=len-2, sell=prices[len-1]; i>=0; i--) {
            if (sell > prices[i]) profit = max(sell - prices[i], profit);
            else                  sell = prices[i];
            rtol[i] = profit;
        }
        int result = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<len; i++) result = max(result, ltor[i] + rtol[i]);
        return result;
    }
};
```

discuss里的思路，初始为0，a表示[0, i) buy一股最多剩余的钱数，b表示[0, i) buy sell一股最多剩余的钱数，c表示[0, i) buy sell buy一股最多剩余的钱数，d表示[0, i) buy sell buy sell剩余最多的钱数。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int len = prices.size(), a=INT_MIN, b=0, c=INT_MIN, d=0;
        for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {
            d = max(d, c+prices[i]);
            c = max(c, b-prices[i]);
            b = max(b, a+prices[i]);
            a = max(a, 0-prices[i]);
        }
        return d;
    }
};
```
