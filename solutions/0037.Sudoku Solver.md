Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:


	Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
	Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
	Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.


Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.


A sudoku puzzle...


...and its solution numbers marked in red.

Note:


	The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
	You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
	The given board size is always 9x9.

思路：广搜，按位置遍历，搜索'.'所有可能值，然后递归搜索下去，看看是否能够得出可能解，9ms。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        solveSudoku(board, 0, 0);
    }
    
    bool solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j) {
        if (i == 9)   return true;
        if (board[i][j] != '.') return solveSudoku(board, i=i+(j+1)/9, (j+1)%9);
        
        char tbl[9] = {0}, ch;
        for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++) {
            ch = board[i][k]; if (ch != '.') tbl[ch-'1'] = 1;
            ch = board[k][j]; if (ch != '.') tbl[ch-'1'] = 1;
            ch = board[i/3*3+k/3][j/3*3+k%3];
            if (ch != '.') tbl[ch-'1'] = 1;
        }

        for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++) {
            if (tbl[k] == 1) continue;
            board[i][j] = '1' + k;
            if (solveSudoku(board, i, j)) return true;
        }
        board[i][j] = '.';
        return false;
    }
};
