Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Example 1:


Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^


Example 2:


Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag

思路：f[i+1,j+1] 表示 s[0...i] t[0...j] 的有多少distinct subsequences，所以
 * 当s[i] == t[j]时，f[i+1,j+1] = f[i,j+1] + f[i,j]。
 * 当s[i] != t[j]时，f[i+1,j+1] = f[i,j+1]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int m = s.length(), n = t.length();
        vector<vector<int>> f(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        for (int i=0; i<m; i++) 
            if (s[i] == t[0]) f[i+1][1] = f[i][1] + 1; 
            else              f[i+1][1] = f[i][1];
        for (int i=1; i<m; i++) for (int j=1; j<n; j++) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) f[i+1][j+1] = f[i][j];
            f[i+1][j+1] += f[i][j+1];
        }
        return f.back().back();
    }
};
```
