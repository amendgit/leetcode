A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right


Example 2:


Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

思路: 每一个格子的可能路径数等于左边格子路径书加上上方格子路径数。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> tbl(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        tbl[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            (i > 0) && (tbl[i][j] += tbl[i-1][j]);
            (j > 0) && (tbl[i][j] += tbl[i][j-1]);
        }
        return tbl.back().back();
    }
};
```
