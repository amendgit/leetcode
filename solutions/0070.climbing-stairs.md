You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:


Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps


Example 2:


Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

思路：f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)，第n步的可能性等于第n-1步加上第n-2步。以此内推即可。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        int a = 3, b = 2, c  = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            a = b + c; c = b; b = a;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
