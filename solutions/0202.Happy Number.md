Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 


Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

用一个set记录重复的值

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> tbl;
        while (n != 1) {
            int m = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int x = n % 10;
                n = n / 10;
                m = m + x*x;
            } 
            n = m;
            if (tbl.find(n) != end(tbl)) 
                return false;
            tbl.insert(n);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

看了discuss有一个思路，借鉴循环链表的思路，一个走一步，一个走两步，可以用常量的空间来找出循环。brilliant
